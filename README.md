# Regression
Perform both linear and nonlinear regression and compare results from the same data. I derived the diffusion coefficient of the target molecule BSA (bovine serum albumin) in 10kD PEGMD hydrogel network. The technique used to derive an empirical relationship between two or more variables based on data obtained from experimental observations is called regression . 

Linear regression depends on a strict linear dependency of the functional for of the parameters to be determined and is a method for modeling the relation between unknown parameters or coefficients of the function are estimated from the data. It is thus desirable to obtain an approximate best fit function that agrees with the data overall.  Nonlinear regression is also a form of regression except the observed data are modeled by a nonlinear function which is a nonlinear combination of model parameters and relies on one or multiple variables.
